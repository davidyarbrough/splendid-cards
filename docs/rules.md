## The Cards

Cards are how players earn points. Cards are displayed in the middle of the table and are available for any player to purchase during their turn.

Players may also reserve cards throughout the game. Reserved cards can only be purchased by the player who reserved them.

Each card provides:
- Points (0 or more)
- A permanent color bonus (used as a discount when purchasing future cards)
- A purchase cost (combination of colored tokens required to acquire it)

## The Tiles

Tiles are displayed in the middle of the table. At the end of a player's turn, they automatically receive a tile if they have accumulated the required permanent color bonuses from their purchased cards.

A player cannot refuse a tile. Receiving a tile is not considered an action. Each tile is worth 3 points, but players can only acquire one tile per turn.

## Gameplay

A random player begins, with play proceeding clockwise. On their turn, a player must choose to perform only one of the following four actions:

1. **Take 3 different tokens** - Take 3 tokens of different colors.
2. **Take 2 same tokens** - Take 2 tokens of the same color (only if there are at least 4 tokens of that color available).
3. **Reserve a card** - Reserve 1 card and take 1 gold token (wildcard).
4. **Purchase a card** - Buy 1 face-up card from the table or a previously reserved card.

## Token Limits

A player can never have more than 10 tokens at the end of their turn (including gold wildcards). If this happens, they must return tokens until they only have 10 left. A player can return any combination of tokens, including those they've just collected.

All tokens owned by a player must be visible to all players at all times.

**Note:** Players may not take 2 tokens of the same color if there are fewer than 4 tokens available of that color.

## Reserving a Card

To reserve a card, a player takes either a face-up card from the middle of the table or draws the top card from one of the three level decks without showing it to the other players.

Reserved cards are kept in hand and cannot be discarded. Players may not have more than three reserved cards in hand, and the only way to use a reserved card is to purchase it on a future turn.

Reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token (wildcard). If there are no gold tokens left, a player can still reserve a card but won't receive a gold token.

## Purchasing a Card

To purchase a card, a player must spend the number of tokens indicated on the card. A gold token can replace any color. The spent tokens (including any gold tokens) are returned to the supply.

A player may purchase either one of the face-up cards in the middle of the table or a card they previously reserved.

Each player arranges their purchased cards by color in front of them, with the cards slightly staggered so that the bonuses and points are visible to all players.

**Note:** When a face-up card is acquired or reserved, it must immediately be replaced by a card of the same level. At all times during the game, there must be 4 face-up cards of each level (unless the respective deck is empty, in which case the spaces remain empty).

## Card Bonuses

The color bonuses a player accumulates from purchased cards provide discounts when buying new cards. Each bonus of a given color is equivalent to one token of that color.

For example, if a player has 2 blue bonuses and wants to purchase a card that costs 2 blue tokens and 1 green token, the player only needs to spend 1 green token.

If a player has enough bonuses, they might even purchase a card without spending any tokens.

## Acquiring Tiles

At the end of their turn, each player checks the available tiles to see if they qualify to receive one. A player can receive a tile if they have at least the quantity and type of card bonuses indicated on the tile.

A player cannot refuse a tile. Receiving a tile is automatic and not considered an action.

If a player qualifies for more than one tile at the end of their turn, that player chooses which tile to receive.

The acquired tile is placed face-up in front of the player.

## End of the Game

When a player reaches 15 points, complete the current round so that each player has played the same number of turns.

The player with the highest number of points is declared the winner (including points from tiles). In case of a tie, the player who has purchased the fewest cards wins.
